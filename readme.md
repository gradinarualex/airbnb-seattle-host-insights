### Datasets
1. [AirBnb Seattle Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)
   The Seattle AirBnB homes data can be used at the above link. You might pair this with the Boston AirBnB data, which can be found at the link below.
2. [AirBnb Boston Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)
   If you are looking to really challenge yourself, data from Seattle and Boston AirBNB homes can be used to understand how much AirBNB homes are earning in certain time frames and areas. You can compare rates between the two cities, or try to understand if there is anything about the properties that helps you predict price. Can you find negative and positive reviews based on text? This dataset requires a number of skills beyond those shown thus far in the course, but if you would like a challenge, this will certainly test your ability to work with messy, real world data.

### Key Steps for Projects
1. Pick a dataset.
2. Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world application of how the data could be used.
3. Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:
  * Prepare data:
    * Gather necessary data to answer your questions
    * Handle categorical and missing data
    * Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
  * Analyze, Model, and Visualize:
    * Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.
4. Communicate your business insights:
  * Create a GitHub repository to share your code and data wrangling/modelling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
  * Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience
